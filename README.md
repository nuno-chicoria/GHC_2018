# ghc_2018
This code was developed in the worldwide qualification round for the Google Hash Code 2018. My team ranked 2254th in a total of 4856 teams who were able to finish in the 4h limit time and we got a score of 25,337,944 in possible 50,000,000. This code was developed by myself and two more colleagues of the Master of Bioinformatics at KU Leuven.
